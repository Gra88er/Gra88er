DevOps / SRE
------------

I'm your go-to guy for anything system administration and making processes run like they're on auto-pilot.
I've got a real soft spot for tech and making things better bit by bit. 
You could say I'm a bit obsessed with turning the chaos of code into something that works smoothly and securely. 
When I'm not knee-deep in automating the heck out of everything, you might catch me shooting hoops, nose in a book, 
or geeking out over the latest in art, fashion, and tech. I'm all about learning new tricks, whether it's in tech or figuring out how to not get schooled on the basketball court.
Let's just say, I'm still working on that last part.
